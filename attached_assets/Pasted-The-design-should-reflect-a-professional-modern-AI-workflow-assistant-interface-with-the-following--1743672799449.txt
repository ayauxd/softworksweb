The design should reflect a professional, modern AI workflow assistant interface with the following layout and behavior:

---

#### 🎯 Section Goal:
Help users initiate AI-related inquiries or connect with a human AI adoption agent for callback.

---

#### 🧠 Assistant Intro Message:
- Center-aligned headline: **"How can we help you today?"**
- Subtext: **"Ask us anything about AI workflows, automation, or agentic system design."**
- Font: Clean and legible (white/light gray on a dark teal background)

---

#### 🔘 Quick Action Buttons (Chips):
- Horizontally centered, evenly spaced chips (no overlap)
- Pill-shaped buttons with subtle glow on hover
- Text on buttons:
  - “Integrate agentic AI”
  - “Automate business process”
  - “Tune large language model”
  - “Enhance workflow”
  - “Book a voice consultation”
- Align in two neat rows if horizontal spacing is tight
- Use a soft outline or low-contrast background fill for inactive state

---

#### 📝 Chat Input Field:
- Full-width rectangular text field, rounded corners
- Placeholder: **“Type your question here…”**
- At the far right of the field: **Send button with an upward-facing arrow icon (↑)** in a circular design
  - On hover: slight glow or bounce animation
  - Background: teal or electric blue, contrasting with input field

> ❌ Do not include a mic icon.

#### 📞 "Talk to an AI Adoption Agent" Section (Below Input):
- Header: **“Talk to an AI Adoption Agent”**
- Left side: **Image of a call center desk** (headset, AI branding, or workflow visuals)
- Right side: Brief copy:
  > “Not sure where to start with AI in your business? Our AI adoption agents are ready to assist with integration planning, workflow strategy, and custom automation.”

- **Button:** “Speak to an Agent”
  - On click: simulate a **“Calling...” animation** (1 second)
  - Then display a **callback form**:
    - Input 1: “Your Phone Number”
    - Input 2: “What would you like to discuss?”
    - Submit Button: “Request Callback”

---

#### 🎨 Visual Style:
- Background: Dark teal (#0C1F25)
- Typography: White/light gray for text, strong contrast
- Button accents: Electric blue, soft gradients, subtle shadows
- Layout: Minimalist, balanced spacing, mobile-responsive alignment
- Inspired by ChatGPT, Intercom, and enterprise AI onboarding UIs

It should resemble a screenshot from a **real, working landing page**, blending the conversational UI with Softworks’ clean branding and functional goal of scheduling AI consultations or answering automation questions.
